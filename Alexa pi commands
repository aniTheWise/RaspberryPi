# Now that you have installed AlexaPi there's a couple of things you need to do.

DO NOT REPORT AN ISSUE UNLESS YOU HAVE READ THIS THOROUGHLY!

# Reboot your machine or start AlexaPi with

sudo systemctl start AlexaPi.service


# Check the status of AlexaPi with

sudo systemctl status AlexaPi.service


# How do I upgrade AlexaPi?
Go to your installation directory, which is /opt/AlexaPi by default:

cd /opt/AlexaPi
Pull from the repo:

sudo git pull
Run the setup script again

sudo ./src/scripts/setup.sh
Start with a fresh config or update your configuration file - consult the config.template.yaml, CHANGELOG.md and Configuration changes wiki page.

# How do I uninstall AlexaPi?
To be nice to AlexaPi, first stop it & disable it:

sudo systemctl disable AlexaPi.service
sudo systemctl stop AlexaPi.service
Remove AlexaPi:

sudo rm -rf /opt/AlexaPi

# For systemd install:
sudo rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/AlexaPi.service.d/
sudo rm /usr/lib/systemd/system/AlexaPi.service

# For classic init install:
sudo rm /var/log/AlexaPi.log
sudo rm /etc/init.d/AlexaPi

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
(optional) Remove all configuration:

sudo rm -rf /etc/opt/AlexaPi

# Can I discover my devices with AlexaPi like with Echo?
No. AVS API doesn't have a way to connect the devices to Amazon. You can probably still do this by setting up your own Alexa skills, but that's a different thing than AlexaPi.

AlexaPi will allow you to control your devices such as Hue provided you also have a genuine Echo in the network which acts as a gateway between the Alexa service and your Hue bridge.

# How do I change my location, time zone, units, ...?
This is not up to us. Do that over at Amazon: https://alexa.amazon.com
